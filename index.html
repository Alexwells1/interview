                        <p>Hi, Friends call me mikun, but my name is Ayomikun, a passionate web developer and designer with well over a few years of experience in creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered digital experiences.</p>
                        <p>My passion has always been creating user-friendly and intuitive interfaces, and I enjoy using wireframing, prototyping, and research to make ideas a reality. I try to make products that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also simple to use because I think that great design is a balance of technology, usability, and aesthetics</p>
                        <p>I specialize in building responsive websites and web applications using modern technologies, I like working on a range of projects that push the limits of user experience, from web platforms to mobile apps. My objective is to solve practical issues, design with empathy, and improve digital interactions</p>
                        <p>When I‚Äôm not behind my Laptop, you‚Äôll probably find me playing video games; Call of Duty Mobile and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang are my favorites, as they challenge me to strategize and think ahead. I also enjoy reading novels when I want to unwind</p>

                <p>In addition to web development, I‚Äôve started exploring C and C#, though these languages have been more challenging due to their complexity. I‚Äôve managed to learn the basics, but there‚Äôs still a lot to explore. My resources have been limited, but I‚Äôm committed to pushing through and improving my understanding of these languages.</p>
                
                <p>I‚Äôve also gained valuable experience as a group leader. I led the development of a Crop Yield Prediction System using machine learning (Random Forest), where I worked on managing large datasets and ensuring data accuracy. I also created UML diagrams and documented software requirements. Another project I led was an e-commerce website for a university group project, where I focused on data structuring and user experience design.</p>
                
                <p>Looking ahead, I‚Äôm excited to continue learning and improving. I want to expand my skills in full-stack development and machine learning, and I‚Äôm always open to exploring new programming languages and technologies.</p>
